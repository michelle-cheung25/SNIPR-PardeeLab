This folder (ouput/fasta) will contain fasta files of the designed SNIPR seqeunces (the first 33 nucleotides of each SNIPR design which estimates the SNIPR docking region) for each target.
Text files containing blast results will be outputted here as well (assuming you change the current directory to the output/fasta folder prior to running the perl web_blast.pl blast script).
